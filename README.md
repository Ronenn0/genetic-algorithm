# Genetic Algorithm Demo 🧬

This project demonstrates a **Genetic Algorithm** implemented using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Built as part of my self-learning journey, it showcases how evolution-inspired logic can be used to reach optimal solutions over time.

## 🤖 What It Does

- Simulates evolution using a population of candidate solutions
- Applies **selection**, **crossover**, and **mutation** techniques
- Visualizes how each generation improves toward a defined goal
- Built entirely with JavaScript and rendered in the browser

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

## 💡 What I Practiced

- Building a custom genetic algorithm from scratch
- Representing chromosomes, fitness scoring, and reproduction
- Implementing mutation and selection logic
- Visualizing data and results using the DOM

## 📚 Background

This project was built in my early coding days while exploring how AI concepts work. It may not be production-grade, but it helped me understand algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.

## ✅ Status

✅ Works in browser  
❌ Not mobile-optimized  
⚠️ Early-stage project for learning purposes
